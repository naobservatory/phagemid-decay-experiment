### statistical inference of decay

- use a statistical model to estimate how much decay has occurred by day 37

 
```{r}
library(rstanarm)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())

library(ggdist)
```


```{r}
x <- data_concentration |>
  filter(
    # treatment_group %in% c('TBS + phagemid', 'wastewater + phagemid')
    treatment_group %in% c('wastewater + phagemid'),
  )
```

```{r}
stan_fit <- stan_glm(
  log10_concentration ~ timepoint + sample_name + plate_well,
  data = x
)
stan_fit %>% summary
```

doesn't converge with default priors, probably because of how crazy the data looks.
probably not a good idea to try to fit this.

TODO: fix metadata so that timepoint is time in days
