This repository contains data and code for analyzing the phagemid decay experiment that was conducted in Jan-Feb 2023.
The experiment was designed and performed by Anjali Gopal, Ari Machtinger, and Laura Sowen.
This repository was created by Dan Rice, who also did the initial analysis.
Mike McLaren later did some file reorganization and created a revised figure for the manuscript.
